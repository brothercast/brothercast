**AI Architect | Full-Stack Developer | Systems Thinker**

Building tools at the intersection of AI, human collaboration, and structured innovation.

## 🎯 Current Focus

I create frameworks that transform ambiguous possibilities into actionable outcomes—treating LLMs as collaborative partners rather than replacements for human judgment.

**Active Projects:**
- [**SSPEC PossPath**](https://github.com/brothercast/PossParse) - An AI-powered project management platform that enables mass collaboration through structured speculation
- [**ExecuTrainSim**](https://github.com/brothercast/ExecuTrainSim) - Dynamic executive training simulations with AI-generated scenarios and branching decision trees

## 🛠️ Technical Evolution

### Advanced Full-Stack Development
My recent work demonstrates proficiency across modern development stacks:

**SSPEC PossPath** showcases:
- Flask backend with SQLAlchemy ORM and PostgreSQL
- Azure OpenAI integration for dynamic content generation
- Complex state management across modal workflows
- Interactive UI with Bootstrap and custom JavaScript
- PDF generation and export functionality

**ExecuTrainSim** demonstrates:
- React front-end architecture with component-based design
- Node.js/Express backend API development
- Real-time AI scenario generation and branching logic
- Multi-role simulation systems with difficulty scaling
- Comprehensive feedback and debriefing mechanisms

### Core Competencies
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, SQL, PowerShell
- **Frameworks:** Flask, React, Node.js/Express
- **Cloud & APIs:** Google Cloud Platform, Azure OpenAI, Gemini APIs
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
- **Tools:** Git/GitHub, Discord APIs, REST architecture

## 🌟 Philosophy

I approach development as a **holistic innovator**—building systems that extend human capability while keeping ethics, advocacy, and tangible outcomes at the center. My frameworks like Structured Speculation translate ambiguous vision into executable workflows, making complex problems tractable through collaborative intelligence.
